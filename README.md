This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in Perl related to the `each` function when used for iterating over hashes. The bug arises from the way `each` modifies the internal hash iterator, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially skipped entries if the hash is modified during iteration. The solution showcases a safer way to iterate over hashes using keys and avoiding such issues.
